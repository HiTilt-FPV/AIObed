## Description
Since there are no affordable, commercially available solutions for bed occupancy detectionâ€”and no elegant open-source alternativesâ€” we decided to take matters into our own hands and build one ourselves. Inspired by the concept of AIOsense, an all-in-one sensor platform for presence and ambient detection in rooms, we created AIObed: a complete platform designed to detect bed occupancy as well as the surrounding area, enabling smart control of features like nightlights.

The goal is to offer a sensor that is modular, affordable, and easy to assembleâ€”with no need for SMD solderingâ€”making it a practical alternative to commercial products. We also prioritize upgradeability, so you wonâ€™t need to repurchase all components with each new PCB revision. In many cases, this sensor is not only more cost-effective but also outperforms existing commercial options.

## Available Sensors / Modules

- Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR)
- PIR motion sensor
- mmWave / Radar sensor
